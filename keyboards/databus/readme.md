Vintage Keyboards With a Data Bus
---------------------------------

When the first keyboards were equipped with microcontrollers in the
                       late 1970s,
    they typically had an 8 - bit data                   bus,
    to which the controller was attached with one of its ports.Through the
            databus it could get code and data from a prom or
        control a set of        indicators – or
        read the sense lines of an 8×N keyboard matrix.
